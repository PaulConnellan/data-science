# NoSQL Databases #

[NoSQL ("Not Only SQL") databases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) are databases that provide a mechanism for storing data that isn't
limited a "relational model" (tabular).  They often provide key/value, graph, or document-based storage and sometimes all of these combined.

Many such systems are focus on horizontal scaling based on clustering, partitioning data, and federating queries.  They are often coupled
with "big data analytics" but are not limited to such applications.  Such database are often better at handling a wider variety of data
with loose relations, semi-structure data formats such as XML or JSON, semantic graphs, and other non-relational models.

In this activity, we'll be looking at two popular document storage NoSQL databases: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org) and [MarkLogic](http://www.marklogic.com)
